          <hr>
          <p>Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry Page
             and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford
             University in California. Together they own about 14% of 
             its publicly listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder 
             voting power through super-voting stock. The company went
              public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015,
               Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of 
               Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is
                a holding company for Alphabet's Internet properties and
                 interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on 
                 October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO 
                 of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the 
                 CEO of Alphabet.</p>
